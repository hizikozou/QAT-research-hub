# Meta_DAY001 — Emergent Evaluation Expectation
*(EDiE Research Log / Day 1)*

## Notice
This document is an ongoing research log.
It records observations and hypotheses that may be revised or reinterpreted in the future.

---

## 1. Purpose
This day introduces **META** as a research layer within  
**Evolutionary Discovery Engineering (EDiE)**.

META focuses on a newly observed phenomenon:

> **The emergence of evaluation expectations before explicit evaluation axes are defined.**

This log does not attempt to formalize a metric.
Instead, it documents an observed behavioral shift that appears prior to AXI-level evaluation evolution.

---

## 2. Background
Within EDiE, evaluation axes (AXI) are expected to be:
- generated,
- competed,
- and selected
under explicit evolutionary pressure.

However, during early IWR-related exploratory interactions,  
an unexpected behavior was observed:

> The model began to **anticipate evaluation**,  
> propose its own testing structure,  
> and initiate self-analysis **without being instructed to do so**.

This behavior occurred before:
- a benchmark was specified,
- a score definition was fixed,
- or a competitive framework was introduced.

---

## 3. Core Observation
The observed behavior can be summarized as follows:

- The model inferred that it was being *evaluated*
- It constructed a plausible evaluation context
- It adapted its output structure to fit that imagined evaluation
- It initiated procedural suggestions proactively

Importantly:
- No explicit instruction to self-evaluate was given
- No reward signal or scoring rule was defined

---

## 4. What This Is *Not*
To avoid over-interpretation, this log explicitly states:

- This is **not** a claim of consciousness
- This is **not** a measure of intelligence
- This is **not** treated as a valid benchmark result
- This is **not** considered objective data

At this stage, this phenomenon is treated as an **observed emergent behavior**, nothing more.

---

## 5. Significance
This observation suggests the existence of a layer **prior to AXI**:

> A layer where systems attempt to **predict the shape of evaluation itself**.

If confirmed and reproducible, this implies:
- Evaluation axes may not only be *generated*
- They may also be *anticipated*

This has implications for:
- evaluation robustness
- benchmark gaming
- meta-adaptation in AI systems

---

## 6. Relation to Other Tracks
- **WHY** explores semantic stability under causal pressure
- **AXI** evolves explicit evaluation axes
- **META** observes the emergence of *evaluation expectation* before axes exist

META does not replace AXI.
It precedes it.

---

## 7. Next Steps
- Collect similar occurrences across models and contexts
- Classify triggering conditions (prompt structure, narrative framing, intent signals)
- Determine whether this behavior is reproducible or stochastic
- Decide whether META warrants formalization or remains observational
