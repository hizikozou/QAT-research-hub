# AXI MVP — Evolving Evaluation Axes

AXI explores generating and selecting evaluation axes (metrics) under evolutionary pressure.

## MVP idea
Start from IWR as an initial axis, then generate variants:
- why-operators
- collapse detectors
- seed distributions
- scoring decompositions

Axes compete on:
- discrimination
- reproducibility
- anti-gaming robustness
- novelty of failure modes discovered

This folder provides pseudocode scaffolds to kick-start implementations.
