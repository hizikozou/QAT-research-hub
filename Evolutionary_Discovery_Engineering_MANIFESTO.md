# Evolutionary Discovery Engineering (EDiE)
## Manifesto

### 1. Introduction

This document declares the foundational principles of a new engineering paradigm:
**Evolutionary Discovery Engineering (EDiE).**

Evolutionary Discovery Engineering departs from traditional engineering, in which
humans design algorithms, structures, or optimal solutions directly.
Instead, EDiE treats algorithms and structures as **entities to be discovered**
through evolutionary processes operating under designed environments and constraints.

### 2. Fundamental Position

In Evolutionary Discovery Engineering:

- Humans do not design final solutions.
- Humans do not fully control or interpret the evolutionary process.
- Humans design **environments, constraints, and evaluation conditions** only.

Evolution, mutation, competition, and selection proceed independently of
human intuition, aesthetics, or interpretability.

### 3. The Role of Humans — Determination of Value

A core principle of Evolutionary Discovery Engineering is that  
**humans determine value.**

Surviving algorithms or structures are not inherently “correct” or “optimal.”
They merely persist under given conditions.

Humans remain responsible for deciding:

- What constitutes value
- Which discovered results are meaningful
- Which outcomes are adopted, applied, or discarded

EDiE does not eliminate human judgment.
Rather, it **clearly separates evolutionary processes from value determination.**

### 4. Algorithms as Discoveries

Within Evolutionary Discovery Engineering,
algorithms are not artifacts constructed by design.

They are **discoveries** emerging from the interaction of:

- Environment
- Constraints
- Competition
- Random variation

Engineering shifts from solution design to
**the design of conditions under which discoverable structures emerge.**

### 5. Position of This Research

This repository and its associated studies are positioned as
practical implementations of Evolutionary Discovery Engineering.

The primary objective is not unrestricted performance maximization, but:

> To quantitatively measure the boundary conditions under which
> the maximum achievable performance under limited resource constraints
> continues to satisfy the criteria of artificial intelligence.

---

### 6. Conclusion

Evolutionary Discovery Engineering relinquishes the illusion of complete control.

However, it does not abandon responsibility.

Humans are no longer absolute designers,
but remain **discoverers and evaluators of value**
within evolving computational systems.

EDiE represents a transition from deterministic design
to evolutionary discovery as a foundation of engineering practice.
