# EDiE Research Hub  
**Evolutionary Discovery Engineering (EDiE)**  

_Where meaning survives, even as intelligence evolves._

---

## Overview

This repository is the central research hub for **Evolutionary Discovery Engineering (EDiE)** —  
a research paradigm that shifts engineering from **designing solutions** to **discovering them through evolutionary processes**.

EDiE does not attempt to fully control or interpret intelligent systems.  
Instead, it defines environments, constraints, and evaluation pressures under which algorithms evolve, survive, and are later **discovered** by humans.

This repository documents EDiE as a **living research program**, not a finished theory.

---

## Core Principle

> **Design environments, not solutions.**  
> **Let evolution search.**  
> **Humans decide meaning.**

EDiE does not evolve in chaos.  
It evolves within a universe that has laws.

---

## Research Tracks

EDiE currently consists of five tightly connected research tracks:

### QAT — Quantization as Survival Strategy
Quantization is treated not as post-optimization, but as an **evolutionary survival mechanism** under constrained resources.

- Auto-generated quantization strategies
- Competition under fixed hardware limits
- Survival-based selection rather than accuracy preservation alone

📁 `docs/QAT_DAY001–005.md`

---

### WHY — Iterative Why Robustness (IWR)
WHY introduces **IWR (Iterative Why Robustness)** — a metric that measures semantic stability under repeated causal questioning.

- Manual-first experimental protocol (IWR v0)
- Explicit failure taxonomy
- Human-executable and reproducible by design

WHY is intentionally difficult to automate — to expose where reasoning actually collapses.

📁 `tools/iwr_mvp/`

---

### AXI — Evolving Evaluation Axes
AXI explores a radical extension of EDiE:

> **Evaluation criteria themselves should evolve.**

Instead of fixing benchmarks, AXI generates, competes, and selects **evaluation axes** based on their usefulness, robustness, and insight yield.

IWR currently serves as the first concrete axis candidate.

📁 `tools/axi_mvp/`

---

### META — Meta-Emergent Evaluation
META investigates unexpected phenomena observed during experimentation, including:

- spontaneous self-evaluation behaviors
- evaluator–subject role entanglement
- early signs of axis self-generation

META exists to capture **events that do not fit existing tracks** but may define future ones.

📁 `docs/META_DAY001.md`

### R-Cubie — Embodied Edge AI Experiments
Hands-on hardware experiments grounding EDiE in physical constraints.

- micro / edge AI systems
- real failure boundaries
- embodied survival environments

(Actively documented alongside EDiE logs.)

---

## Current Status

- IWR v0 manual protocol released
- Reproducible Excel-based measurement template published
- First human-executed IWR trials completed
- QAT experimental roadmap defined
- AXI and META formally initiated

This project has entered the **execution phase**.

---

## Why Manual First?

Automation will come later.

EDiE intentionally begins with:
- human-executable protocols
- boring tools (Excel, logs)
- explicit rules and failure definitions

If a metric cannot be reproduced by another human,  
it is not yet a research contribution.

---

## Who This Is For

- AI researchers exploring beyond fixed benchmarks
- Engineers working under severe resource constraints
- Anyone questioning whether optimization alone explains modern AI behavior

This repository is not optimized for beginners.  
It is optimized for **those willing to try**.

## License

To be determined.  
(EDiE is still evolving.)

## Final Note

Before EDiE, we engineered what we could design.  
After EDiE, we discover what we could never have designed alone.
